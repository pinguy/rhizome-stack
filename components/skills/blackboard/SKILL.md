# Blackboard

Use when several models or agents must hand off one task without collapsing observations, guesses, decisions, actions, and test evidence into a notes blob.

This is an external coordination workspace. J-space is an internal model mechanism; this skill borrows only the selective shared-workspace idea and makes handoffs persistent and auditable.

## Operating model: a working kitchen in shifts

Treat contributors as specialist kitchen staff working overlapping shifts. The board is the shared station state and handover sheet, not a transcript of everybody's internal monologue.

Every worker must be able to establish:

- what is completed;
- what remains outstanding;
- what is in progress and who owns it;
- what failed and should not be repeated blindly;
- what resource, quota, time, hop, storage, or context budget is running low;
- what is hazardous or requires verification;
- what is reserved or **DO NOT TOUCH**;
- the exact next bounded action.

Workers need the relevant shared state; they do not need every other worker's private reasoning. Router and supervisory layers may expose only the entries relevant to the assigned capability while preserving full provenance underneath.

## Core rule

Read blackboard → validate station state → claim one bounded job → attach receipts → update hazards/resources/protected state → request the next capability → unload.

Never rewrite another contributor's entry. Append corrections or verification.

### Context rule

The append-only board is the durable audit record, not default prompt payload. Use `summary` for normal model turns and `route-results` for the current routed job. Use full `show` only for audit, recovery, or when the compact view is demonstrably insufficient.

Do not keep old entries resident merely because they exist. Preserve them on the board and promote only the state needed for the current job into model context.

## Start

Use `scripts/blackboard.py`; do not hand-edit a live board.

```bash
python scripts/blackboard.py init BOARD.json --goal "..." --model "provider/model" --max-hops 6
python scripts/blackboard.py summary BOARD.json
```

The board owns `policy.max_hops`; later commands cannot override it. Mutations lock the board for the full load/validate/change/write transaction, increment `revision`, write atomically, and preserve a timestamped backup. Use `--expect-revision N` on mutations when the caller has read a particular revision.

Read `references/schema.md` before router integration.

## One-hop workflow

1. Run `validate`. Stop on schema, policy, state, route-loop, ownership, or provenance failure.
2. Read the goal, typed collections, `revision`, current `next`, unresolved questions, active ownership, constraints, hazards, and remaining limits.
3. Claim or confirm exactly one bounded job matching the assigned capability. Do not duplicate active work.
4. Keep contributions typed:
   - `facts`: directly observed or source-stated claims.
   - `inferences`: interpretations, hypotheses, conclusions.
   - `user_decisions`: authenticated user choices, approvals, and constraints.
   - `evidence`: receipt locators, hashes, excerpts, tool results.
   - `actions`: operations actually attempted or completed.
   - `test_results`: explicit `PASS:` or `FAIL:` outcomes.
   - `failed_attempts`: failed approaches and boundaries.
   - `open_questions`: unresolved questions.
5. Every entry carries writer, timestamp, provenance, verification state, and route/ownership identity where the schema supports it.
6. Before any action, run `guard --target ...`. Every recorded action also requires `--target` and repeats the constraint check.
7. Destructive actions additionally require `--destructive --approval-entry UUID`. Approval must be a user-provenance decision whose exact content is `APPROVE: <target>`; it is single-use.
8. Before routing, record material resource pressure, hazards, stale assumptions, and protected targets. Never silently hand over a nearly exhausted budget or an unverified dangerous state.
9. Set the smallest next capability and bounded instruction with `route`. Routing is allowed only from `active`.
10. End the model turn after handoff.

## Shift handover contract

A route, pause, lead-model change, or session close must leave a compact operational handover containing:

1. **Outcome / current state**
2. **Completed**, with receipt locators
3. **In progress / owner**
4. **Outstanding**
5. **Failures / do not repeat**
6. **Running low / limits**
7. **Hazards / must verify**
8. **Reserved / DO_NOT_TOUCH**
9. **Exact next action and required capability**
10. **Revision, route ID, locks, and rollback**

Use `none known` rather than leaving safety-critical categories ambiguous. Do not dump chain-of-thought. Preserve conclusions, evidence, decisions, failure boundaries, and state needed for continuation.

## User constraints and identity boundary

`DO_NOT_TOUCH: <target>` is the machine-readable equivalent of a reserved item in the walk-in. It is a hard constraint and blocks that exact target and descendants.

The helper requires every `user_decisions` entry to have a `user/*` writer identity and at least one `provenance.kind=user` source. A JSON file cannot authenticate a human by itself: the router or calling environment must bind `user/*` and user provenance to the authenticated inbound user, and must not expose those credentials as model-selectable strings.

## State

Allowed transitions are mechanically enforced:

- `active` → `needs_user`, `needs_verification`, `blocked`, or `completed`.
- `needs_user` → `active` only after a newer user decision.
- `needs_verification` → `active`, `blocked`, or `completed`.
- `blocked` and `completed` are terminal.

Completion requires a `PASS:` test written by a model that did not perform the tested non-route action, or a PASS entry independently verified by another model. Merely having a test-result entry is insufficient.

Raising `policy.max_hops` requires an unused user decision exactly matching `APPROVE_POLICY: max_hops OLD -> NEW`. Lowering it cannot go below the current hop count.

## Verification

A writer cannot verify its own entry. A verifier checks cited provenance, appends verification, and records a typed verdict.

Verification is the incoming shift checking the label and station rather than trusting that “done” was written. Critical, volatile, destructive, or recovery-sensitive claims must be rechecked before action.

```bash
python scripts/blackboard.py validate BOARD.json
```

Use `references/canary.md` for the three-model canary.
